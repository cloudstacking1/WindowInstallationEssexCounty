      <h2> FAQs (People Also Ask)</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq1')">Q: How long do replacement windows typically last?</button>
        <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A: Most replacement windows last around 15 to 20 years before performance declines due to weakening seals, drafts, or aging materials. Beyond this lifespan, issues like condensation between panes, warping, or visible damage are common indicators it's time for a full replacement.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2')">Q. Do replacement windows pay for themselves in energy savings?</button>
        <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">While energy-efficient replacement windows can offer annual savings—typically between 7% and 15% on household energy bills—the initial investment is often substantial. Many homeowners recoup around 78% of the cost when selling their home, and tax credits (up to $1,200) may help offset expenses.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq3')">Q. When is the best time of year to replace windows?
</button>
        <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">Although windows can be replaced year-round, spring and fall are generally the ideal seasons. During these milder periods, contractors are more available, and homeowners avoid the extreme temperatures that can disrupt installation or cause heating/cooling loss.</div>
